Untriaged rows extracted from completed plans' *Out of scope* / *Deferred* /
*Open questions* sections. Every row here is awaiting classification by
`/triage` (Issue B, [#204](https://github.com/maratik123/quartzite/issues/204))
— do not hand-edit.

This file is the universal landing zone for both forward-going propagation
(`/task` Step 12 appends one row per spec section after merging a plan) and
the one-shot backfill that seeded it. `/triage` drains rows by sorting each
into a thematic file (`signals-slots.md`, `ci-docs-workflow.md`, etc.),
promoting to a GitHub issue, or dropping with the literal `untracked`
decline-marker token written into the `Tracked` cell.

**Write discipline.** Hand-edits to this file are FORBIDDEN per the
`AGENTS.md` AXIOM (*Workflow* section, anchor `_inbox.md`) — only `/task`
Step 12 and `/triage` may write here.

**Schema.** 4-column markdown table. `Section` records which spec heading
the row was pulled from (`out-of-scope` / `deferred` / `open-question`).
`Tracked` mirrors cell 4 of the 8 thematic files — initially `—`,
rewritten to `#N` on promotion or `untracked` on decline by `/triage`.
