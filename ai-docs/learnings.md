### 2026-05-02 — code-style — let chains are allowed and formattable in edition 2024

**What happened:** During the macros task, rustfmt errored on a let chain with "let chains are only allowed in Rust 2024 or later". The workspace uses `edition = "2024"`, Rust 1.95, and rustfmt 1.9.0 — all of which support let chains. The error was caused by running rustfmt without `--edition 2024` explicitly, or against a stale binary. The response was to replace let chains wholesale with match expressions as a blanket rule.

**Rule:** Let chains (`if let A = x && let B = y { ... }`) are valid in this codebase. Do not avoid them. Run `rustfmt` via `cargo fmt` (which picks up the workspace edition automatically) rather than invoking `rustfmt <file>` directly.
