# Delete the local progress files belonging to the merged branch passed as $1.
#
# Run by `/pr-merged` skill (.claude/skills/pr-merged/SKILL.md, step 3) after
# `git checkout master && git pull`, before `git branch -d <previous-branch>`.
#
# Derivation (PR linkage):
#   1. `gh pr list --state merged --head <branch>` -> merged PR number
#   2. `gh pr view <PR_NUM> --json body` -> PR body
#   3. `grep -oiE '(Close[sd]?|Fix(es|ed)?|Resolve[sd]?) #[0-9]+'` on the body
#      -> the first Closes/Fixes/Resolves #N reference. ISSUE_NUM is the
#      trailing digits. (Per /task + /interview convention every spec carries
#      `**Tracked in:** #<ISSUE_NUM>`, not #<PR_NUM>.)
#   4. `grep -lE "^\*\*Tracked in:\*\* #<ISSUE_NUM>"` in ai-docs/plans/done/
#      + ai-docs/plans/ -> matching /task spec file. The anchor on `^**Tracked
#      in:** ` prevents prose lines that mention "Tracked in:" alongside a
#      different #N (e.g. spec narrative discussing another spec's tracking
#      issue) from false-matching.
#   5. `basename <spec>.spec.md` -> spec-base name
#   6. Delete ai-docs/plans/<spec-base>.progress.md (if it exists)
#   7. Delete ai-docs/pr-comments/pr-<PR_NUM>.progress.md (the fallback path
#      used by /pr-commented for PRs not produced by /task)
#   8. Delete ai-docs/ci-fixes/pr-<PR_NUM>.progress.md (the fallback path
#      used by /pr-ci-failed for PRs not produced by /task)
#   9. `rmdir ai-docs/pr-comments ai-docs/ci-fixes ai-docs/master-ci`
#      -- opportunistic cleanup; non-fatal if the directories still have
#      unrelated files or do not exist.
#
# Secondary derivation (master-ci run linkage):
#   A. `gh pr view <PR_NUM> --json body` -> PR body (same body fetch as
#      step 2 -- the secondary probe runs against the same `${PR_BODY}`).
#   B. `grep -oE '^\*\*Tracked in run:\*\* [0-9]+'` on the body -> the
#      first `**Tracked in run:** <run-id>` reference. RUN_ID is the
#      trailing digits. /master-ci-failed writes this line into the body
#      of the fresh PR it opens; the per-run progress file lives at
#      `ai-docs/master-ci/<run-id>.progress.md` (gitignored).
#   C. Delete ai-docs/master-ci/<RUN_ID>.progress.md (if it exists).
#
# A PR may carry both `Closes/Fixes/Resolves #N` (primary path) and
# `**Tracked in run:** <run-id>` (secondary path) -- both probes run
# unconditionally and independently. They are not mutually exclusive: a
# /pr-ci-failed run on a /task-produced PR may still surface a fresh
# /master-ci-failed sibling PR carrying the run-id line.
#
# Failure modes (all exit 0 -- workflow step 4 proceeds regardless):
# - `PR_NUM` empty (branch merged outside `gh`, or PR is closed-not-merged):
#   prints a one-line note to stdout and exits 0 (nothing reliable to derive
#   paths from).
# - `ISSUE_NUM` empty (PR body has no Closes/Fixes/Resolves #N line -- e.g.
#   manual non-/task PR, or `/task` PR whose body convention drifted, or a
#   /master-ci-failed-produced PR which has no upstream tracking issue):
#   prints a one-line warning to STDERR naming the PR and branch, skips the
#   /task-progress-file deletion, proceeds to the fallback + secondary
#   probe paths.
# - `SPEC_PATH` empty (issue number derived but no spec carries
#   `Tracked in: #<ISSUE_NUM>` -- e.g. PR closes a satellite issue without
#   its own /task spec): prints a one-line warning to STDERR naming the
#   issue number, skips the /task-progress-file deletion, proceeds to the
#   fallback + secondary probe paths.
# - `RUN_ID` empty (PR body has no `**Tracked in run:** <run-id>` line --
#   the common case: every /task PR, every /pr-ci-failed PR, every manual
#   PR. Only /master-ci-failed-produced PRs carry the line.): silent
#   no-op; the master-ci secondary probe simply does not match. No
#   warning -- absence of this line is the norm, not an anomaly.
# - rm -f is silent on missing files (intentional -- files may not exist;
#   idempotent re-runs are safe).
# - rmdir failing on non-empty directory is expected and ignored.
#
# Multi-close PRs (rare; e.g. `Closes #289` + `Closes #277` on PR #295):
# the FIRST closing-keyword match wins. By convention the first-listed
# issue is the primary /task tracking issue; satellite closures are
# bundled cleanup items without their own spec. The same FIRST-match rule
# applies to multi-`**Tracked in run:**` PR bodies (rare; a single PR
# rarely references more than one master CI run).
#
# Deferred-task progress files (ai-docs/plans/deferred/) are intentionally
# NOT touched -- deferral is its own workflow and a deferred task has no
# merged PR to drive cleanup.
