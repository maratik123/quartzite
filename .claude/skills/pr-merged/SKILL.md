Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

Working tree:
```!
git status --porcelain
```

If the current branch is `master`, stop and tell the user this skill must be run while standing on the merged PR branch.

If `git status --porcelain` above is non-empty (any modified, staged, or untracked entries), stop and ask the user how to proceed (commit, stash, discard, ignore). Do not run any further commands until the user answers.

Otherwise, run in order. **Capture `<previous-branch>` from the `Current branch:` value above before step 1** — once `git checkout master` runs, `git branch --show-current` no longer returns it.

1. `git checkout master`
2. `git pull`
3. **Delete the merged branch's local progress files** (gitignored Subagent artefacts; no longer needed). Run the cleanup script:

   ```bash
   ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cleanup-progress.sh <previous-branch>
   ```

   The script encapsulates the PR-linkage derivation (PR number → spec lookup → progress-file paths) and handles the failure modes:
   - **`PR_NUM` empty** (branch merged outside `gh`, or PR is closed-not-merged): prints `pr-merged: no merged PR found for <previous-branch>; skipping progress-file cleanup.` and exits 0.
   - **No matching `/task` spec** (manual PR without `/task`): skips the `/task`-progress-file deletion silently; the `/pr-comments` fallback path is still attempted.
   - **`rmdir` on `ai-docs/pr-comments`** is opportunistic — non-fatal if the directory has unrelated files or doesn't exist; exit code ignored.

   Deferred-task progress files (`ai-docs/plans/deferred/`) are intentionally NOT touched — deferral is its own workflow and a deferred task has no merged PR to drive cleanup. Source: [`scripts/cleanup-progress.sh`](scripts/cleanup-progress.sh).

4. `git branch -d <previous-branch>` — always `-d`, never `-D`. If `-d` refuses because the branch is not fully merged, stop and report the message; do not force-delete.

## Patterns

### 1. Auto-delete the merged local branch without a confirmation pause

*Default to* running `git branch -d <previous-branch>` immediately at step 4 of the workflow without pausing for user confirmation. *Prefer* the silent auto-delete over an `AskUserQuestion` prompt — `git branch -d` is the safe form (refuses to delete unmerged branches), and the user has already invoked this skill specifically to perform cleanup; pausing for a yes/no on a guaranteed-safe operation is friction without protection. If `-d` refuses (branch not fully merged), stop and report; do NOT escalate to `-D` without an explicit user instruction.

Validated by user feedback (`feedback_remove_merged_branches.md` in user-local auto-memory): "Remove merged local branches without asking — `git branch -d` merged branches after `git pull`; do not pause to confirm". Carrot surfaced via `/improve` 2026-05-22 Step 1c.

### 2. The `design-system` branch is a long-lived exemption from auto-delete

*Default to* leaving the `design-system` branch alone — DO NOT include it in the step-4 `git branch -d` call even when `git branch --merged master` reports it as merged. The branch is intentionally long-lived and lives on both local + origin even after individual merges back into master.

When sweeping merged branches in bulk (manual cleanup outside the `<previous-branch>` argument), explicitly exclude `design-system`:

```bash
git branch --merged master | grep -v -E '^\*|^\s*(master|design-system)\s*$' | xargs -r git branch -d
```

Validated by user feedback (`project_design_system_branch.md` in user-local auto-memory): "`design-system` branch is long-lived — exempt from auto-delete; keep on both local + origin even after merges". Carrot surfaced via `/improve` 2026-05-22 Step 1c.
