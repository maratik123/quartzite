Full workflow for a task. Steps execute **strictly in sequence** — proceeding to N+1 before N is complete is FORBIDDEN.

> **Commit authorization.** The default rule "only commit when the user explicitly asks" does **not** apply inside this workflow. Commits at Step 8 (per subtask) and the commit + `git push` + `gh pr create` at Step 12 are pre-authorized by `/task` itself — perform them without an extra prompt. Pause to confirm only if the situation is ambiguous beyond the prescribed step (e.g., commits would touch master, files outside the task scope, or sensitive paths).

The task may originate from either:
- a **GitHub issue number** (e.g. `/task 42` or `/task #42`) — `/interview` reads the issue body during Steps 1–5
- a **user description** (e.g. `/task add foo to bar`) or empty (`/interview` interviews the user)

## ⚡ First: check for active task

```bash
ls ai-docs/plans/*.progress.md 2>/dev/null
```

> **Re-entry-after-compaction case (lost-arguments path).** If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty (lost to
> compaction) AND the glob above finds a matching file with `**entry_args:**` recorded, treat the recorded
> `entry_args` as the canonical entry reference. The `⚡ Second` and `⚡ Third` preambles must NOT fire on the **lost-arguments path** — they require a positive match against the live `$ARGUMENTS`, which by definition is unavailable on re-entry. Only `⚡ First` (active-task probe) is allowed to route a lost-arguments re-entry. If the probe finds no matching progress file, the re-entry is "fresh"; surface this to the user (do NOT proceed to Steps 1–5 silently, because the user's original task is unknown).

**If found → validate the match BEFORE jumping to RESUME.** The probe is a flat glob — it matches any `.progress.md` regardless of git branch or merge state. Run the four-step **stale-merge + branch-match** validation in `reference.md` § ⚡ First — validation sequence (detail). If either check fails, surface to user with **delete / park / RESUME anyway** options before continuing; do NOT auto-RESUME on a mismatch.

**RESUME flow (skip Steps 1–7) — only after validation passes:**
1. Read the `.progress.md` file
2. Read spec — only `## Acceptance Criteria`
3. Read only files from `## Files touched`
4. Jump to `## Next action`
5. Tell user: "Found active task [X], resuming from [subtask Y]"

---

## ⚡ Second: check for deferred plan activation

> **Guard sentence.** This preamble fires only when `$ARGUMENTS` is **non-empty**. On a lost-arguments re-entry (empty `$ARGUMENTS` after compaction), do NOT enter this preamble — fall through to `⚡ First`'s active-task probe instead. See `⚡ First`'s lost-arguments clause.

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains words like "activate", "start", "proceed" **and** a matching plan exists in `ai-docs/plans/deferred/`, run the deferred-plan activation sequence in `reference.md` § ⚡ Second — deferred plan activation sequence: move spec/design (and `.progress.md` if present) from `deferred/` to `ai-docs/plans/`, update `INDEX.md`, verify `**Tracked in:**`, then resume the moved `.progress.md` if any (else skip Steps 1–7 and jump to Step 8).

---

## ⚡ Third: bare-issue activation of a matching deferred spec

> **Guard sentence.** This preamble fires only when `$ARGUMENTS` is **non-empty** (a bare integer). On a lost-arguments re-entry (empty `$ARGUMENTS` after compaction), do NOT enter this preamble — fall through to `⚡ First`'s active-task probe instead. See `⚡ First`'s lost-arguments clause.

> **AXIOM — When `$ARGUMENTS` is a bare gh issue number, search deferred specs for `**Tracked in:** #N` BEFORE launching the interview.** A bare integer does NOT trigger the keyword preamble (`⚡ Second`), so `/task 47` would otherwise spin up a spurious interview state file even when a deferred spec already carries `**Tracked in:** #47`. See `reference.md` § ⚡ Third — bare-issue activation decision table (detail) for the resolution table.

Activation sequence (bare-issue → matching deferred spec): parse `$ARGUMENTS` (strip leading `#`), load `gh issue view <N> --json title,body,state,labels`, grep `ai-docs/plans/deferred/*.spec.md` for `**Tracked in:** #N`. **Zero matches** → fall through to Steps 1–5. **One match** → move the spec (and `*.design.md` / `*.progress.md` siblings if present) into `ai-docs/plans/`, update `INDEX.md`, surface the spec's ACs for user confirmation, do NOT re-run interview, do NOT create `*.state.md`, then jump to Step 6 (or RESUME if a `.progress.md` came along). **Multiple matches** → surface to user. Full sequence: `reference.md` § ⚡ Third — bare-issue activation sequence (full).

---

### Steps 1–5: Spec creation (delegated to `/interview`)

`/task` does not duplicate the interview workflow. Treat Steps 1–5 as a single delegated phase. If a saved spec already exists under `ai-docs/plans/`, confirm with the user and skip to Step 6. Otherwise invoke `Skill(skill="interview", args="$ARGUMENTS")` — the interview handles entry-mode detection, scope confirmation, clarifying-question rounds, tracking-issue resolution, spec writing, and the cross-link comment. Spec-only runs move the spec to `ai-docs/plans/deferred/` and stop. **Before Step 6:** confirm the spec exists at `ai-docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-name.spec.md` and the user has approved its `## Acceptance Criteria`. Full delegation narrative: `reference.md` § Steps 1–5 — spec creation delegation (detail).

### Step 6: Design agent

First action: confirm the spec exists. Spawn the `design` agent (per `.claude/agents/design.md`) with the spec path; result: `ai-docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-name.design.md`.

### Step 7: Design review

Spawn the `design-review` agent (per `.claude/agents/design-review.md`) with the spec + design paths.

Verdict: GO / ITERATE / STOP.
- **GO** → proceed to Step 8. Spec-amending notes (AC/constraint changes) need Step 6 → Step 7 re-run, not a fold-in — see `reference.md` § Spec Amendment recipe.
- **ITERATE** → back to Step 6 (max 3 rounds total).
- **STOP** → fundamental flaw with the approach. Surface the verdict and `Issues` table to the user, do not start Step 8. Wait for direction (e.g., narrow scope, change approach, abandon).

### Design Amendment (re-entrant — triggered from Step 8 or Step 11)

If implementation (Step 8) reveals a necessary deviation from the design, **or** a self-review finding (Step 11) requires a design change rather than a code fix: stop the step, surface to user for approval, update the design doc, re-run Step 7 design-review (max 3 rounds total). On GO → resume the triggering step. See `reference.md` § Design Amendment recipe for the full procedure.

> Silently implementing a deviation without triggering Design Amendment — FORBIDDEN.

---

### Step 8: Implementation

> First action: verify spec + design + GO verdict exist AND that every `note`/`minor`/recommendation from the latest design-review GO has been written back into the design document. "Applied in code later" is NOT the same as "resolved in the design"; the design doc is the implementation contract. See `reference.md` § Step 8 — first-action GO-notes verification (detail). Unresolved GO-notes = previous steps incomplete.

- **Create a feature branch immediately** — before writing any code or making any commits:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feat/YYYY-MM-DD-name
  ```
  Use the same date-name as the spec file. Record the branch name in the progress file.
- **Before every `git commit` in this step:** run `git branch --show-current` and confirm it is NOT `master`. If it is — stop immediately, do not commit, apply the recovery procedure in AGENTS.md.
- **Before every `git commit` in this step:** check `git status` for `ai-docs/learnings.md`. If modified or untracked, stage it together with the related code changes — learnings are part of the task deliverable and must be visible in the PR diff. **After every push** (CI fix, reviewer-comment fix, self-review fix): if a learning entry was written *after* the last code commit landed, give it its own commit on the feature branch in the same turn — do not leave `learnings.md` as an unstaged working-tree change waiting to be bundled with the next code change. Order: write learning → `git add ai-docs/learnings.md` → commit → push.
- Create `ai-docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-name.progress.md` at start using the canonical schema at [`ai-docs/templates/progress-format.md`](../../../ai-docs/templates/progress-format.md). Required: `**Branch:**`, `**base_commit:**`, `**Last build:**`, `**current_step:**`, `**last_passed_gate:**`, `**entry_args:**`, plus a `## Decisions log` h2 section. For `/task` flows also include `**Issue:**` / `**Spec:**`. Record `**entry_args:**` (original `$ARGUMENTS` — bare ref, keyword phrase, free text, or `(none)`) ONCE and **read-only thereafter**; on lost-arguments re-entry it is the canonical entry reference. Full header template + write-once rule: `reference.md` § Step 8 — progress-file creation template (detail).
- After each subtask:
  1. `cargo build` — must compile
  2. `cargo test test_name` — if subtask adds tests
  3. `cargo fmt`; `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
  4. Update `.progress.md` — **at this subtask boundary, rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 8 — subtask N of M complete`; rewrite `**last_passed_gate:**` to `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings | <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> | <commit SHA from git rev-parse HEAD>`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet for any non-trivial choice made during this subtask (one line, prefixed `Step 8 subtask N:`; omit if none).**
  5. **Every-group handoff (binding, not optional).** During Step 8 the orchestrator NEVER executes subtask code in its own context — every group fans out through `/context-reset`, including the first group, and including designs whose total subtask count is M = 1. Spawn `/context-reset` at the start of each group per the design's `## Handoff plan` section (the per-group spec; required for every M ≥ 1 per `.claude/agents/design.md` § Rules → handoff-grouping). Between group returns the orchestrator reads the subagent's progress-file delta (`current_step`, `last_passed_gate`, tail of `## Decisions log`) and re-validates state — branch matches `**Branch:**`, `base_commit` unchanged in the progress header, no uncommitted dirt (`git diff --quiet` returns clean) — before spawning the next group's handoff. If the runtime delta disagrees with the design's `## Handoff plan` (e.g. extra subtasks completed, group boundary moved), trigger the **Design Amendment recipe** (`reference.md` § Design Amendment recipe) — do NOT silently advance. Orchestrator model is per-invocation; pinning was considered and rejected (Key Decision Q3 of the every-group redesign — see spec/design at `ai-docs/plans/done/2026-05-16-task-step-8-group-handoff.spec.md`). See `reference.md` § Every-group handoff (rationale) for the failure modes this prevents and `.claude/skills/context-reset/SKILL.md` for the handoff protocol.
- Unknown API → read sources → grep codebase → ask user. Don't guess.
- Bug report during impl → activate `/bugfix`, then return here.
- Implementation reveals design must change → trigger **Design Amendment** above, then resume here.
- **Local FAIL investigation before push (AGENTS.md workflow corollary).** When `cargo test` returns `FAILED`, isolate and reproduce the failing test before treating it as transient. See `reference.md` § Step 8 — local FAIL investigation before push for the recipe.

### Step 9: Verify

Run the full 11-step verify list in `reference.md` § Step 9 — verify list (full): `cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings -D missing-docs" cargo doc --no-deps --workspace --all-features`, `actionlint` (only if workflows changed), panic-index sync (see `reference.md` § Step 9 — panic-index sync (detail) for the exact `rg` recipes), unsafe-index sync (see `reference.md` § Step 9 — unsafe-index sync (detail) for the exact `rg` recipes), then per-AC coverage check and a `| # | Criterion | Test / Verification | Status |` summary table. On ALL PASS → Step 9.5.

**Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 9 — Verify (ALL PASS)`; rewrite `**last_passed_gate:**` to `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings -D missing-docs" cargo doc --no-deps --workspace --all-features | <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> | <commit SHA from git rev-parse HEAD>`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording panic-index additions and unsafe-index additions, if any (one line, prefixed `Step 9:`; omit if none).

### Step 9.5: Update documentation

Update content files only — **do not move spec/design to `done/` yet** (that happens at Step 12). Touch `ai-docs/context.md` (open questions / Plans list / Key Decisions) and `README.md` (status table for newly implemented crates). Full detail: `reference.md` § Step 9.5 — documentation update (detail).

**Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 9.5 — docs updated`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording any open questions resolved in `context.md` (one line, prefixed `Step 9.5:`; omit if none).

Then proceed to Step 10.

### Step 10: Self-review loop (max 3 rounds)

Spawn the `self-review` agent with the spec, design, and progress paths (per `.claude/agents/self-review.md`).

**On APPROVE:** proceed to Step 12. The progress file is gitignored and **stays in the working tree** — `/pr-commented` extends it across reviewer rounds, `/pr-merged` deletes it post-merge. Do NOT `rm` it here. **Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 10 — self-review APPROVE (Round N)`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording the round count (one line, prefixed `Step 10:`).

**On REJECT:** proceed to Step 11. After Step 11, loop back here. **Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 10 — self-review REJECT (Round N), addressing findings`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording the finding count + severity breakdown (one line, prefixed `Step 10:`).

**After round 3 with REJECT:** surface all remaining `⬜ Open` findings to the user and ask how to proceed.

### Step 11: Review fixes

For each `⬜ Open` finding in the latest `## Self-Review (Round N)` section of the progress file: **fix** (mark `✅ Fixed`), **design-amend** (trigger the Design Amendment recipe, mark `✅ Fixed (design amended)`), or **object** (`nit`/`minor` autonomously; `major`/`blocker` only after user approval — mark `⚠️ Objected: <reason>`). See `reference.md` § Step 11 — review-fix narrative for the full procedure including the unconditional PR-body re-read and review-thread-resolution recipe.

After all findings are resolved, run gates (`cargo build`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`) and:

1. Update `.progress.md`.
2. **PR body sync (unconditional).** `gh pr view <N> --json title,body`, re-read, then `gh pr edit` only if the body contradicts the new commits. Never skip the read.
3. **Resolve fixed review threads (unconditional).** GraphQL recipe per `reference.md` and [`ai-docs/workflow.md`](../../../ai-docs/workflow.md#pr-review-comment-resolution).
4. **Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 11 — review fixes complete (Round N)`; rewrite `**last_passed_gate:**` to `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings | <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> | <commit SHA from git rev-parse HEAD>`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording any `⚠️ Objected` rationale or Design-Amendment trigger (one line, prefixed `Step 11:`; omit if none).
5. Return to Step 10.

### Step 12: Finalise docs, commit, and create PR

1. **Confirm `.progress.md` is NOT staged.** It is gitignored (`/ai-docs/plans/**/*.progress.md`); `git status` should not list it. If accidentally tracked or staged, unstage / `git rm --cached`. The file MUST stay in the working tree but MUST NOT enter the commit.
2. Confirm `git branch --show-current` is **not** `master`. If it is — stop, do not push, tell the user, apply the AGENTS.md recovery procedure.
3. **Finalise INDEX.md and move plan files:**
   - Change the plan row status to `✅ implemented (N tests)`
   - Move spec/design files to `ai-docs/plans/done/`
   - Update dependency tree and **Suggested next steps**
4. **Inbox propagation — parse the just-finalised spec (and its design if present) and append rows to `ai-docs/deferred/_inbox.md`.** Apply the file-level dedupe rule against the 8 thematic files in `ai-docs/deferred/`; emit a `WARN:` line on unrecognised body shapes and continue. Full per-shape parser + dedupe rules in `reference.md` § Step 12 — inbox propagation (detail) and in [`inbox-propagation.md`](inbox-propagation.md). The Step 12 commit (sub-step 7 below) stages `_inbox.md` alongside the existing artefacts.
5. **Regenerate dependent artefacts** (e.g. `bash scripts/gen-roadmap.sh` → `ROADMAP.md` when `INDEX.md` or `done/**` changed) and stage them with the same commit. See `reference.md` § Step 12 — regenerate dependent artefacts (detail).
6. `cargo build` — ensures `Cargo.lock` is refreshed and included if changed.
7. Stage all changed files: implementation files from `## Files touched`, `context.md`, `README.md`, `ai-docs/learnings.md` (if modified), updated `INDEX.md`, regenerated artefacts (e.g. `ROADMAP.md`), `ai-docs/deferred/_inbox.md` (rows appended in sub-step 4), and spec/design now in `done/`.
8. Commit `feat(<crate>): <imperative summary>` with a 1–3 line body and `N new tests; all M tests green.`
9. `git push -u origin <branch>`
10. `gh pr create` with title + body — body must include **Summary** / **Tracking** (`Closes #N` for full-resolve or `Refs #N` for partial; omit if `Tracked in: none`) / **Test plan** (one line per AC + clippy/build). Full body template: `reference.md` § Step 12 — PR-body template (detail).
11. Post the PR URL to the user.
12. **Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 12 — PR opened (PR #<N>)`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording the PR number and the spec/design `done/` move (one line, prefixed `Step 12:`).

After the PR is created, the unconditional PR-body re-read rule (AGENTS.md *Workflow*) applies to any subsequent push on this branch: `gh pr view <N>` first, then `gh pr edit` only if the body now contradicts the diff.

**Reviewer comments arrive after Step 12** — run `/pr-commented` (one round per invocation, re-invocable). Do not re-enter `/task` for routine reviewer feedback; architectural-rework requests are the exception (`/pr-commented` bails → fresh `/task` design-review cycle).
