Reactive bug-fixing workflow. **Fundamentally different from `/task`:**
- First step is analysis, NOT code
- Failing test is written BEFORE the fix, not after

> ⛔ **Do NOT open Edit, do NOT write code until Step 2 (Root Cause) is complete.**

> **⚡ Compaction recovery check — read FIRST on every invocation.**
> If you are re-entering this skill after auto-compaction (a
> summary/compaction block appears at the top of context, or workflow
> context feels thin), STOP before any tool call and:
>
> 1. **Locate the durable-state file** — list `ls ai-docs/bugfix/trace-*.md 2>/dev/null`.
>    If exactly one in-flight artefact exists, that's the durable state.

## Step 1: Reproduce and Trace

> **Re-entry-after-compaction case.** If a trace file exists at
> `ai-docs/bugfix/trace-*.md`, read it top-to-bottom (per the
> compaction-recovery callout above). Then:
>
> | Trace state | Action |
> |---|---|
> | `Confirmed by user: ⏳ PENDING` (or missing) | Re-execute Step 1 normally — the trace was created but the user never confirmed. Re-show it and ask confirmation. |
> | `Confirmed by user: ✅ YES` AND `**current_step:**` ≥ Step 2 | **Skip Step 1**. Resume from the step recorded in `**current_step:**`. Do NOT re-trace, do NOT re-ask the user. |
> | `Confirmed by user: ✅ YES` but `**current_step:**` missing or blank | Treat as Step 1 just finished; resume at Step 2. |
> | Multiple matching trace files | Surface to user; do NOT auto-pick. |

**Goal:** understand the exact sequence of events — what happens now, step by step.

> **⛔ BEFORE ANY FIX: DATA FIRST, THEN CODE.**
> Code shows what CAN happen. Data shows what DID happen.
> Hypothesis without data = guess.

Spawn the embedded `Explore` Subagent via the `Agent` Tool to trace the actual execution path. `Explore` is read-only by contract (no `Edit` / `Write` / nested `Agent`); it returns the ASCII sequence diagram AND the file:line citations supporting each arrow. The orchestrator (this skill) writes the trace artefact below from `Explore`'s output — `Explore` cannot write files.

The spawn `prompt` MUST embed the verbatim `ast-index.md § Rules for subagents` block (the subagent does NOT inherit `.claude/rules/ast-index.md`).

```
Agent(subagent_type="Explore", prompt="
  Trace the actual execution path for this bug and return:
  (1) an ASCII sequence diagram matching the template below — adapt the components to the real ones, label the divergence point explicitly;
  (2) file:line citations supporting each arrow in the diagram.

  Template to fill:
  ```
  [ACTUAL]
  Caller -(method())-> ServiceA -(query())-> DaoB
  DaoB -(N records)-> ServiceA
  ServiceA: applies logic X, but expected logic Y
  ServiceA -(wrong result)-> Caller

  [EXPECTED]
  Caller -(method())-> ServiceA
  ServiceA -(correct result)-> Caller
  ```

  Use `ast-index` via Bash for code search (NOT grep / the `Grep` Tool):
    ast-index search \"query\"           — universal search
    ast-index file \"Name\"              — find a file by name fragment
    ast-index symbol \"Name\"            — find a symbol definition
    ast-index class \"Name\"             — find a class / trait / struct / enum
    ast-index usages \"Name\"            — every usage of a symbol
    ast-index callers \"func\"           — functions that call this one
    ast-index implementations \"Trait\"  — concrete implementors of a trait
    ast-index refs \"Name\"              — cross-references (defs + imports + usages)
  Use Grep ONLY if ast-index returned empty.

  Before Read-ing any file over 500 lines, FIRST run
    ast-index outline <file>
  to get its structure, then Read only the targeted slice via offset/limit.
  Never bulk-read large files.
")
```

`Explore`'s returned diagram + citations feed into Step 1's inner-step 1 (artefact creation) below.

**Inner steps — in this exact order:**

1. Create artifact `ai-docs/bugfix/trace-YYYY-MM-DD-<short-name>.md` (use today's date, kebab-case name):

```markdown
# Bugfix Trace: <bug description>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Reporter: <quote from user message>

**current_step:** Step 1: Reproduce and Trace
**last_passed_gate:** (none yet)
**parent_skill:** /task    <!-- only when /bugfix is invoked from /task Step 8; omit otherwise -->
**entry_args:** <copy of $ARGUMENTS at trace creation; omit if empty>

## Actual behaviour
<ASCII sequence diagram showing what DID happen, with divergence point labelled>

## Expected behaviour
<ASCII sequence diagram showing what SHOULD happen>

## Confirmed by user: ⏳ PENDING

## Decisions log

- Step 1: <one-line description of a non-trivial decision made during this step>
```

The four new header lines and the `## Decisions log` h2 match the canonical schema at [`ai-docs/templates/progress-format.md`](../../../ai-docs/templates/progress-format.md). The trace file is the `/bugfix`-flavoured progress file — no parallel `.progress.md` is created.

2. Show the trace to the user and ask: **"Did I understand the behaviour correctly?"**
3. After the user confirms — update the artifact: `Confirmed by user: ✅ YES`
4. **Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 1: Reproduce and Trace — confirmed`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording the trace's divergence point (one line, prefixed `Step 1:`).
5. **Do NOT proceed to Step 2 until the user confirms the trace.**

> **Artifact is required.** Step 2 starts with `Read ai-docs/bugfix/trace-*.md`.

---

## Step 2: Root Cause

> **First action:** `Read ai-docs/bugfix/trace-*.md`. If file missing — go back to Step 1.

Based on the confirmed trace — find the single point of failure.

**Rule:** root cause is **one place** in code where behavior diverges from the component's contract. If there are multiple candidates — those are symptoms, dig deeper.

1. Read only files involved in the trace
2. Find the line where the contract is violated
3. State: `"Root cause: function_name() in src/foo.rs line N — does X instead of Y"`
4. Append to the trace artifact:
   ```markdown
   ## Root Cause
   `function_name()` in `src/foo.rs` line N — does X instead of Y
   Confirmed by user: ⏳ PENDING
   ```
5. Show root cause to user. After confirmation → `✅ YES`.
6. **Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 2: Root Cause — confirmed`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording the root-cause location (one line, prefixed `Step 2:`).

---

## Step 3: Failing Test (REQUIRED, before Edit)

> ⛔ **Step 4 (Fix) is BLOCKED until the test is red.**

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Test written with the same data as the bug report
- [ ] Test run: `cargo test test_name`
- [ ] Test is **RED** with the expected error (not compile error — specifically assertion fail)
- [ ] Only after a red test → Edit

**Test must:**
- Be in `#[cfg(test)]` module or `tests/` directory
- Verify an invariant (comment out the fix → test must fail)
- Be named as a behavior description: `returns_error_when_input_empty`

**If the test does NOT fail:**
- You didn't find the root cause → go back to Step 2
- OR assertion is too weak → rewrite the assertion
- ⛔ Do NOT proceed to fix while test is still green

**Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 3: Failing Test — red`; rewrite `**last_passed_gate:**` to `cargo test <test_name> (RED as expected) | <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> | <commit SHA from git rev-parse HEAD>`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording the test name and the invariant it locks (one line, prefixed `Step 3:`).

---

## Step 4: Plan + Regression Check

Before Edit — make a plan:

1. What exactly to change (file, function, ~lines)
2. What might break (adjacent components)
3. Which existing tests cover adjacent code — run them

**Show plan to user if:**
- Change touches >1 file
- You're changing the same file for the second time in a row (loop signal)

**Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 4: Plan + Regression Check`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording the planned change scope (one line, prefixed `Step 4:`).

---

## Step 5: Fix

Now open Edit.

**One-file rule:** if fix requires changes in >3 files — you're fixing a symptom, not the root cause. STOP, go back to Step 2.

**One-attempt rule:** if a new bug appeared in the same place after the fix — STOP. Draw a full system diagram, show it to the user.

**Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 5: Fix`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording the file(s) and lines touched (one line, prefixed `Step 5:`).

---

## Step 6: Verify

1. Run the failing test from Step 3: `cargo test test_name` — must turn green
2. Run the full suite: `cargo test` — confirm nothing else broke
3. Run `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` for changed files
4. Run `cargo fmt`
5. **Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 6: Verify — green`; rewrite `**last_passed_gate:**` to `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings | <ISO-8601 UTC timestamp> | <commit SHA from git rev-parse HEAD>`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording any non-trivial regressions caught and resolved (one line, prefixed `Step 6:`; omit the bullet if no decision was needed).

> ⛔ **Do NOT delete the trace artifact yet — Step 6.5 still needs it as the spec-equivalent input for the `self-review` Subagent.**

---

## Step 6.5: Self-review (loop, max 3 rounds — same semantics as `/task` Step 10)

> ⛔ **`/bugfix` cannot report Step 6 as complete and proceed to commit / push until self-review issues APPROVE.** A `/bugfix` PR has the same code-quality bar as a `/task` PR — both land on master after merge. Build-system gates (clippy / fmt / test) catch what the compiler and lints know about; they do NOT catch "this literal should be a named const", "this rustdoc paragraph contradicts the fix", "this fix touches a sibling concern that should be a separate PR" — exactly the class of nits a human reviewer raises. _See `ai-docs/learnings.md` 2026-05-13 `/bugfix`-Step-6-lacks-self-review entry: PR #333 shipped a magic-number literal that `self-review` would have caught pre-push but didn't run, costing one extra `/pr-commented` round._

1. Determine the diff window:
   - **Standalone `/bugfix`** (entry point was a user bug report): `<base>` is the branch's merge-base against `origin/master` when no commits exist yet; once N commits are staged or committed (but not pushed) on the branch, `<base>` is `HEAD~N` against the pre-fix tip. Pass the resolved base as the `base_commit` to the Subagent.
   - **`/bugfix` invoked from `/task` Steps 8–12** (per the task SKILL Step 8 "Bug report during impl → activate `/bugfix`" hand-off): the diff window is the bugfix's own staged-but-not-pushed commits — NOT the entire `/task` diff. Parent `/task` Step 10 covers the full task diff later; the per-bugfix self-review catches nits inside the bug's window before they get conflated with task-scope feedback.

2. Spawn the `self-review` Subagent with the trace artifact as the spec-equivalent input:

   ```
   Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="
     Read .claude/agents/self-review.md and follow it.
     This is a /bugfix self-review (no /task spec; no design doc).

     Spec-equivalent: ai-docs/bugfix/trace-YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md
       — use the trace's 'Actual behaviour', 'Expected behaviour', and
         'Root Cause' sections as the AC-equivalent. The fix is correct iff
         the diff makes Actual match Expected at the labelled divergence
         point and addresses exactly the documented Root Cause.

     Out-of-scope reminder: this self-review is scoped to fitness-against-
     the-bug, NOT fitness-against-some-broader-task. Do not raise findings
     about pre-existing code outside the bug's diff window.

     Diff window: git diff <base_commit>..HEAD
     Progress file (write findings here): ai-docs/bugfix/trace-YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md
       — append a '## Self-Review (Round N)' section in the canonical format;
         count existing sections in the trace artifact to determine N.
   ")
   ```

3. **On APPROVE:** proceed to Step 7 (artifact deletion + final cleanup). **Write progress at this step boundary** before further tool calls: rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 6.5: Self-review — APPROVE (Round N)`; append a `## Decisions log` bullet recording the round count and any objections accepted (one line, prefixed `Step 6.5:`).
4. **On REJECT:** loop back to Step 5 (Fix) — address each `⬜ Open` finding (severity ladder applies — `major`/`blocker` may require user confirmation before objecting per the same rules `/task` Step 11 enforces). After fixes, return here for Round N+1. Rewrite `**current_step:**` to `Step 6.5: Self-review — REJECT (Round N), addressing findings` before re-entering Step 5.
5. **After Round 3 with REJECT:** STOP. Do not commit / push. Surface remaining `⬜ Open` findings to the user and wait for direction (escalate to a wider design-amendment cycle, accept the findings as out-of-scope nits, or abandon the fix).

---

## Step 7: Cleanup (only after Step 6.5 APPROVE)

1. **Delete the trace artifact:** `git rm ai-docs/bugfix/trace-*.md 2>/dev/null || rm -f ai-docs/bugfix/trace-*.md` (handles both tracked and untracked traces)

---

## ⛔ Anti-pattern: fix-break cycle

```
Bug report → Edit → regression → bug report → Edit → regression → ...
```

**Signs you're in a loop:**
- User describes a similar symptom for the second time
- You're changing the same file >2 times
- User asks "why did you decide to do it that way?"

**Breaking the loop:**
1. STOP — close all Edits
2. Draw a full system diagram: all components + data flow + interactions
3. Show to user
4. Wait for understanding confirmation
5. Only then continue
